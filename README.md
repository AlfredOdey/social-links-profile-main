## My process
As always: look at the sample from time to time, and build the solution to look like it as closely as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a littl about Flexbox, and developing for mobile and desktop view at the same time.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@media (min-width: 600px) {
    header {
        margin-left: 725px;
        margin-top: 100px;
        width: 350px;
    }


}


### Continued development

I just realized that I do not know enough CSS. I still need to learn more about it.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/responsive-web-design-how-to-make-a-website-look-good-on-phones-and-tablets/) - This helped me for mobile and desktop layout. I really liked this discovery and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/responsive-web-design-how-to-make-a-website-look-good-on-phones-and-tablets/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
